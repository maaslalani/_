# Clean Code

Clean Code is a set of principles and practices from Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)
for writing software that is readable, maintainable, and expressive. The core idea
is that code is read far more often than it is written, so optimizing for readability
is optimizing for productivity. This skill covers the Clean Code book's principles,
SOLID object-oriented design, and test-driven development - giving an agent the
judgment to write, review, and refactor code the way a disciplined craftsman would.

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Asks to review code for quality, readability, or maintainability
- Wants to refactor a function, class, or module to be cleaner
- Needs help naming variables, functions, or classes
- Asks about SOLID principles or how to apply them
- Wants to decompose a large function or class
- Asks to identify code smells or technical debt
- Wants to write tests using TDD (red-green-refactor)
- Needs to improve error handling patterns

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- Performance optimization (clean code prioritizes readability, not speed)
- Architecture decisions at the system level (use clean-architecture skills instead)

---

## Key principles

1. **The Boy Scout Rule** - Leave the code cleaner than you found it. Every commit
   is an opportunity to improve a name, extract a helper, or remove dead code.

2. **Readability is king** - Code should read like well-written prose. If a reader
   needs to pause and re-read a line, that line needs work. Clever code is bad code.

3. **Single Responsibility at every level** - Every function does one thing. Every
   class has one reason to change. Every module has one area of responsibility.

4. **Express intent, don't document it** - The code itself should explain what and
   why. Comments that explain "what" the code does indicate the code failed to
   communicate. Reserve comments for "why" something non-obvious was chosen.

5. **Small is beautiful** - Functions should be 5-20 lines. Classes should be
   small enough to describe in one sentence. Files should fit a mental model.

---

## Core concepts

Clean Code rests on a hierarchy of concerns, from the smallest unit to the largest:

**Names** are the most fundamental tool. A good name eliminates the need for
comments, makes intent obvious, and prevents misuse. Names should be
intention-revealing, pronounceable, and searchable. See `references/naming-guide.md`.

**Functions** are the building blocks. Each function should do one thing, operate at
one level of abstraction, and have as few arguments as possible. The "stepdown rule"
means code reads top-to-bottom like a newspaper - high-level summary first, details
below.

**SOLID principles** govern class and module design. They prevent rigid, fragile code
that breaks in unexpected places when changed. See `references/solid-principles.md`.

**Code smells** are surface indicators of deeper structural problems. Recognizing
smells is the first step to refactoring. See `references/code-smells.md`.

**Tests** are the safety net that enables fearless refactoring. TDD (test-driven
development) ensures tests exist before code and that code is only as complex as
needed. See `references/tdd.md`.

## Common tasks

### Review code for Clean Code violations

Walk through the code looking for violations in this priority order:

1. **Naming** - Are names intention-revealing? Can you understand the code without reading comments?
2. **Function size** - Any function over 20 lines? Does it do more than one thing?
3. **Abstraction levels** - Does the function mix high-level logic with low-level detail?
4. **Duplication** - Any copy-paste code or structural duplication?
5. **Error handling** - Are errors handled with exceptions, not return codes? Any null returns?

**Before (violations):**
```javascript
// Check if user can access the resource
function check(u, r) {
  if (u != null) {
    if (u.role == 'admin') {
      return true;
    } else if (u.perms != null) {
      for (let i = 0; i < u.perms.length; i++) {
        if (u.perms[i].rid == r.id && u.perms[i].level >= 2) {
          return true;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

**After (clean):**
```javascript
function canUserAccessResource(user, resource) {
  if (!user) return false;
  if (user.isAdmin()) return true;
  return user.hasPermissionFor(resource, Permission.READ);
}
```

### Refactor a long function

Apply the Extract Method pattern. Identify clusters of lines that operate at the
same level of abstraction and give them a name.

**Before:**
```python
def process_order(order):
    # validate
    if not order.items:
        raise ValueError("Empty order")
    if not order.customer:
        raise ValueError("No customer")
    for item in order.items:
        if item.quantity <= 0:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid quantity for {item.name}")

    # calculate totals
    subtotal = sum(item.price * item.quantity for item in order.items)
    tax = subtotal * 0.08
    shipping = 5.99 if subtotal < 50 else 0
    total = subtotal + tax + shipping

    # charge
    payment = gateway.charge(order.customer.payment_method, total)
    if not payment.success:
        raise PaymentError(payment.error)

    # send confirmation
    send_email(order.customer.email, "Order confirmed", f"Total: ${total:.2f}")
```

**After:**
```python
def process_order(order):
    validate_order(order)
    total = calculate_total(order)
    charge_customer(order.customer, total)
    send_confirmation(order.customer, total)
```

Each extracted function is independently readable, testable, and reusable.

### Improve naming

Apply these rules by entity type:

| Entity | Rule | Bad | Good |
|---|---|---|---|
| Boolean | Should read as a true/false question | `flag`, `status` | `isActive`, `hasPermission` |
| Function | Verb + noun, describes action | `data()`, `process()` | `fetchUserProfile()`, `validateEmail()` |
| Class | Noun, describes what it is | `Manager`, `Processor` | `EmailSender`, `InvoiceCalculator` |
| Collection | Plural noun | `list`, `data` | `activeUsers`, `pendingOrders` |
| Constant | Screaming snake case, self-documenting | `86400` | `SECONDS_PER_DAY = 86400` |

See `references/naming-guide.md` for the full guide.

### Apply SOLID principles

When a class is hard to change, test, or reuse, check it against SOLID:

- **S**ingle Responsibility - Does this class have more than one reason to change? Split it.
- **O**pen/Closed - Can you extend behavior without modifying existing code? Use polymorphism.
- **L**iskov Substitution - Can subtypes replace their parent without breaking things?
- **I**nterface Segregation - Are clients forced to depend on methods they don't use? Split the interface.
- **D**ependency Inversion - Do high-level modules depend on low-level details? Inject abstractions.

See `references/solid-principles.md` for detailed examples and when NOT to apply each.

### Write clean tests with TDD

Follow the red-green-refactor cycle:

1. **Red** - Write a failing test that defines the desired behavior
2. **Green** - Write the minimum code to make it pass
3. **Refactor** - Clean up both production and test code

Tests should follow the FIRST principles (Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely) and use the Arrange-Act-Assert structure.

See `references/tdd.md` for the full guide.

### Clean up error handling

Replace error codes with exceptions. Never return or pass null.

**Before:**
```java
public int withdraw(Account account, int amount) {
    if (account == null) return -1;
    if (amount > account.getBalance()) return -2;
    account.debit(amount);
    return 0;
}
// Caller: if (withdraw(acct, 100) == -2) { ... }
```

**After:**
```java
public void withdraw(Account account, int amount) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(account, "Account must not be null");
    if (amount > account.getBalance()) {
        throw new InsufficientFundsException(account, amount);
    }
    account.debit(amount);
}
// Caller: try { withdraw(acct, 100); } catch (InsufficientFundsException e) { ... }
```

> Prefer unchecked (runtime) exceptions. Checked exceptions violate the Open/Closed
> Principle - a new exception in a low-level function forces signature changes up
> the entire call chain.

## Anti-patterns / common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Over-abstracting | Creating interfaces, factories, and layers for simple problems adds complexity without value | Only abstract when you have a concrete second use case, not "just in case" |
| Comment-phobia | Deleting ALL comments including genuinely useful "why" explanations | Remove "what" comments, keep "why" comments. Regex explanations and business rule context are valuable |
| Tiny function obsession | Breaking code into dozens of 2-line functions destroys readability | Extract when a block has a clear name and purpose, not just because it's "long" |
| Dogmatic SOLID | Creating an interface for every class, even with one implementation | Apply SOLID when you feel the pain of rigidity, not preemptively everywhere |
| Magic refactoring | Refactoring without tests, hoping nothing breaks | Always have test coverage before refactoring. Write tests first if they don't exist |
| Naming paralysis | Names so long they hurt readability (`AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean`) | Names should be proportional to scope. Loop variable `i` is fine; module-level needs more |
| TDD cargo-culting | Testing implementation details (private methods, mock internals) | Test behavior and public contracts, not implementation. Tests should survive refactoring |

## Gotchas

1. **Refactoring without a safety net** - Extract Method and Rename refactors look safe but break things when the surrounding code has implicit coupling, side effects, or no test coverage. Always ensure tests cover the behavior being refactored before making any structural change - even a "trivial" rename.

2. **Over-decomposing into micro-functions** - Splitting a 40-line function into 15 two-line helpers makes individual pieces shorter but the flow incomprehensible. Extract only when the extracted block has a name that is more informative than reading the code itself. Length is not the trigger; clarity is.

3. **Applying SOLID to one-off utilities** - Adding an interface for a class that has exactly one implementation "to follow Dependency Inversion" introduces indirection without value. Apply SOLID principles when you feel friction from rigidity or testability problems, not preemptively as a ritual.

4. **Comments explaining what, not why** - After a refactor, leftover "what" comments that now contradict the code are worse than no comments. They mislead future readers. Delete any comment that describes the operation of code that has since been renamed or restructured to be self-explanatory.

5. **TDD on implementation, not behavior** - Writing tests that call private methods or assert on internal state means the tests break every refactor, defeating the purpose of having tests. Test only through public interfaces and observable outputs; the test should survive any internal restructuring.
